# 🚀 Project Overview

Financial fraud is one of the biggest challenges in digital transactions. This project builds an AI-powered fraud detection system capable of identifying suspicious credit card transactions and classifying them as:

- ✅ Genuine Transaction
- 🚨 Fraudulent Transaction

The system uses machine learning techniques to handle highly imbalanced transaction data, train classification models, evaluate performance, and provide explainable predictions.

# 📊 Dataset Information

Dataset:

**Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset**

Source:

Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset


## Dataset Statistics

| Information | Value |
|---|---:|
| Total Transactions | 284,807 |
| Fraud Transactions | 492 |
| Genuine Transactions | 284,315 |
| Features | 30 |
| Fraud Ratio | 0.172% |


The dataset contains:

- Time
- Amount
- PCA transformed features (V1-V28)
- Class label

Where:

```
0 → Genuine Transaction

1 → Fraudulent Transaction
```

# ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow


## 1. Data Preprocessing

Performed:

- Missing value analysis
- Feature scaling
- Data normalization
- Train-test split


## 2. Handling Class Imbalance

Credit card fraud datasets are highly imbalanced.

Applied:

**SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**

to improve fraud detection capability.


## 3. Model Training

Implemented models:

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | Baseline model |
| Random Forest | Final selected model |
| XGBoost | Advanced comparison model |


---

# 🏆 Model Performance

## Final Model

### Random Forest Classifier


| Metric | Score |
|---|---:|
| Accuracy | 99.94% |
| Precision | 82.47% |
| Recall | 81.63% |
| F1 Score | 82.05% |
| ROC-AUC | 98.32% |


Random Forest was selected because it provided the best balance between:

- Fraud detection capability
- Precision
- Recall
- Generalization performance


---

# 🔍 Explainable AI

The system uses SHAP to explain model decisions.


Example explanations:

- Which features increased fraud probability
- Which features reduced risk
- Feature contribution ranking


SHAP provides transparency and improves trust in AI-based financial decisions.
